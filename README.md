This is a course on product ownership. It is intended for state and federal agency teams who are managing complex build and deploy projects. 

The course is best taken in community with others. You should have at least one buddy to work with, talk to, and discuss the learning.

We recommend 2-3.5 hours/week for this material; 1-2 hours for reading, thinking, writing, and reflection, and between 1 and 1.5 hours for conversation with a partner and/or your learning team.
