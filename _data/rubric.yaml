- header: Iterative development
  question: Does the state use iterative, secure development practices?
  wtm: More important than any individual practice or technique, healthy design and development teams are able to iterate quickly by 1) identifying process failures and opportunities for improvement, and 2) adjusting and improving their approach accordingly, in real time. <br>&nbsp;<br> The more insight a state has, the better able they are at identifying whether they are on track or not. One tool states use for this is <i>testing</i>. There are many different types of testing. CMS is in the process of releasing new testing guidance to teams.
