# Federalist + U.S. Web Design System + Jekyll

This [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) is developed using the [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov) and is focused on providing developers a starter kit and reference implementation for Federalist websites.

This code uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site engine and built with Ruby. If you prefer to use Javascript, check out [federalist-uswds-gatsby](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby), which uses [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) site engine.

This project strives to be compliant with requirements set by [21st Century IDEA Act](https://www.meritalk.com/articles/senate-passes-idea-act/). The standards require that a website or digital service:

- is accessible to individuals with disabilities;
- has a consistent appearance;
- does not duplicate any legacy websites (the legislation also requires agencies to ensure that legacy websites are regularly reviewed, removed, and consolidated);
- has a search function;
- uses an industry standard secure connection;
- “is designed around user needs with data-driven analysis influencing management and development decisions, using qualitative and quantitative data to determine user goals, needs, and behaviors, and continually test the website, web-based form, web-based application, or digital service to ensure that user needs are addressed;”
- allows for user customization; and
- is mobile-friendly.

### Running the application

#### With Docker
    $ docker-compose run node npm install
    $ docker-compose build
    $ docker-compose up

To build but not serve the site, run:
```
docker-compose run ruby bundle exec jekyll build
```
.

Note that when built by Federalist, `npm run federalist` is used instead of
`npm run build`.

Open your web browser to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to view your
site.

### Testing

#### With locally installed `node` and `ruby`
    $ npm test
    OR
    $ bundle exec htmlproofer _site; npx a11y '_site/**/*.html'

#### With Docker
    $ docker-compose run ruby bundle exec htmlproofer _site; npx a11y '_site/**/*.html'

## Technologies you should be familiarize yourself with

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) - The primary site engine that builds your code and content.
- [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter) - The top of each page/post includes keywords within `--` tags. This is meta data that helps Jekyll build the site, but you can also use it to pass custom variables.
- [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov)
