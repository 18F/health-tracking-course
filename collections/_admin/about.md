State Officer, M.D. (SOMD) is a learning course that uses cohort discussion and learning in community to develop skills to evaluate software project health. SOMD gives the learner a tour of best software development and project management practices to help learners recognize good and poor project health. 

SOMD's course material is built around the 4 primary indicators of project health, taken from the [Health Rubric]({{"/rubric/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) &mdash; outcomes-orientation, state capacity, procurement flexibility, and iterative development.  


This site contains lesson materials, a facilatation guide, and supplemental material.
