State Officer, M.D. (SOMD) is a learning course that uses cohort discussion and learning in community to develop skills to evaluate software project health. SOMD gives the learner a tour of best software development, project management, and vendor management practices to help learners recognize good and poor project health. 

SOMD's course material is built around the 4 primary indicators of project health, taken from the [Health Rubric]({{"/rubric/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) &mdash; outcomes-orientation, state capacity, procurement flexibility, and iterative development.  


This site contains lesson materials, a facilatation guide, and supplemental material. These materials were originally developed to help State Officers evaluate and shepherd their state's projects, but the materials have value for anyone who would like to gain a better perspective on software project health.
