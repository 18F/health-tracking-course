title: Course Facilitation
---

It is not possible, in one page, to lay out how to facilitate the State Officer, M.D. course. Being an effective educator is the work of years of study, practice, and reflection. To say or suggest otherwise is disrespectful to those who have made education their vocation and career. 

With that acknowledgement, the goal of this page is to provide high-level principles and practices that might help guide facilitators in their efforts. The course is written in such a way that it encourages high impact practices on the part of the facilitators and participants; along with this brief guide, if you follow the structure of the lessons, you will be on the path to successful facilitation.

## Values

The first thing that you need to fix in your mind, and **revisit regularly**, are the values you intend to bring to the facilitation. It is worthwhile doing a debrief with your co-facilitator(s) after every session, especially while you are starting out as a facilitator. This provides you with a space to decompress, to reflect on whether you achieved your goals for the session, and what you intend to keep, change, add, or throw away from your practices for the next session. This regular retrospective practice allows you to keep your values front-and-center throughout your practices and the facilitation process.

We have approached our work with the following values in mind:

1. Our colleague's time is precious.
2. Care and compassion for others.
4. Learning in community
3. Justice awaits.

We expand on each of these briefly, and provide references where appropriate to help further ground the ideas we summarize here.

### Our colleague's time is precious

The people we are working with have hard jobs, and they are taking time from other work to engage in this learning and growth. Therefore, we only want to engage in activities that clearly focus the participants on valuable content, practices they can apply, or evaluative reflection that will help transform their practices and thinking. However, taken to an extreme, this kind of thinking becomes oppressive (a word we use knowingly, and might place in the context of other words like *patriarchy* and *supremacy*). Our point here is emphatically **not** that there is "only room for the work." Instead, we emphasize that our colleagues' time is valuable, and we try not to ever forget that their time, spent on these materials, is valuable to them, but it is also *a  gift to us*.

### Care and compassion for others 

Our first offering of this course was during the COVID-19 pandemic, during the continuation of significant civil rights protests, the 2020 election cycle, and the seditious interruption of Congress and the violation of the Capitol building itself. As federal employees, seeing colleagues in other branches of the government abdicate their oaths to the Constitution---and the harm that causes to people across the nation---*hurts*. 
    
Our participants had children at home, were worried about family, and like us, were working from home under what remain trying and exceptional circumstances. As we launched our second course, and prepared to scale to additional cohorts, a new, more virulent strain of the coronovirus is spreading across the nation, and the current pace of vaccine distribution in the country will not reach every adult for over a year.
    
While your learning facilitation might not take place during such trying times, our point in emphasizing these things is that **our facilitation is not separate from the world**. Therefore, taking time at the start of each session for centering exercises was something that our colleagues explicitly praised; it gave them a moment of peace, and helped them focus on the moment, as opposed to the last three video calls they had just taken part in. Allowing space for humor, for human sharing... the check-in time was a moment to lift up ourselves, each-other, and remind ourselves that there is good in the world, even when it feels like everything is on downward spiral. **Care and compassion for others** is an essential part of any good educational effort, and we believe that is all the more true in remote learning.

### Learning in community

We have imagined these lessons as material to be undertaken by State Officers *in community with each other*. Our reasons for this are many. First, it provides SOs with people to talk and think with as they are engaging in the material of the lessons. Second, it builds community amongst the SOs, creating informal networks of sharing and resource pooling where they might not currently exist. Third, it creates a firmament in which conversation about organizational practice and process can take place, allowing thoughts and practices that transform the organization to take root and grow.

The work of Lave and Wenger regarding communities of practice and situated learning are relevant source literature for these ideas, as well as Bandura's social learning theory.

### Justice awaits 

Health should be a fundamental right. In the United States, it is not---we must find healthcare through a capitalist marketplace. One in five people in the United States rely on Medicaid and CHIP, and therefore on the systems that support those programs. The work of supporting the State Officers is fundamentally human rights work, and about addressing what we view as unjust and inequitable access to healthcare in the United States. Bringing a justice-oriented mindset to the work, and supporting SOs in seeing their work as potentially transformative for a significant percentage of the US population, is something we view as critical to this work.

## High-Impact Practices

In education, we typically talk about "high-impact practices." These are activities, structures, or educational engagements that have, through years of qualitative and quantitative research, been demonstrated to improve the students' learning experience. That might mean improving retention of content, or it might mean growing self-efficacy and notions of self-worth as it relates to the course and its goals/outcomes.
