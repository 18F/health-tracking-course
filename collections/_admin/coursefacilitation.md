## Introduction

Course facilitation is an opportunity to guide learners to link course material to their personal experiences. This guide intends to help the considerations and planning involved with the facilitation of courses like State Officer, M.D. (SOMD). 

### Time commitment

* Weekly full-cohort discussions (1 hour)
* Facilitator weekly planning (2 hours)
* Small group meetings (30 minutes) 
* Homework (1-2 hours weekly)

Total: 2.5-3.5 hours for cohort members

## Values

It’s important to start with an overview of the values that underlaid the course and its facilitation. While a more thorough discussion of the values in the course is given at the [Learning Cohorts page]({{ “admin/learningcohorts/” | prepend: site.baseurl }}), we’ve briefly summarized the values below and how they relate to our approach to facilitation.

## Values

The first thing that you need to fix in your mind, and **revisit regularly**, are the values you intend to bring to the facilitation. 

We expand on each of these briefly, and provide references where appropriate to help further ground the ideas we summarize here.

### Facilitating learning cohorts

Here’s an outline of the 4 major facilitation values and how they relate to the wider learning cohort values.

* Learning in community 
    * Small communities (6-8 people max) are best for supporting learners and encouraging mutual accountability as they engage in learning and transformation.
    * Partcipants create informal networks of sharing and resource pooling where they might not currently exist.
    * Discussion and sharing of personal experiences helps participants learn new principles. Learning discussions in small groups is the ideal landscape for effective facilitation. Smaller group sizes are important to help learners feel comfortable sharing their experiences and for each learner’s voice to be heard. The facilitator encourages this community learning and sharing with question prompts that probe learners to share.
    * Participants' conversation about organizational practice and process can take place, allowing thoughts and practices that transform the organization to take root and grow.
* Respect the learner
    * Dedicated time to dive deep into learning is a part of the State Officer job and work week.
    * Individual time is valuable and limited &mdash; facilatation and materials should add value.
    * Individual preparation and reflection enhances group discussions and knowledge exchange.
    * Learning and developing are a continuous process. It takes time and community support to develop new ways of working and thinking.
* Create space for the “real”
    * Care and compassion for others is an essential part of any good educational effort &mdash; faciliatation and dicussion is not seperate from the world at large.
    * Centering exercises at the start of group discussions to help learners stay present and ready to listen and share.
    * Time and space for learners to share something good from their week or do a short meditation improve the discussion.
* Empowering learners as agents of change/justice.
    * Building learner confidence helps them to better identify and improve outcomes.
    * Recognizing learner’s agency and power in their daily work helps them realize this in themselves. 

## Process

Facilitation is a process that begins long before you are “in the room” with learners. 

### Planning Ahead: Grouping Learners

Given our commitments to learning in community with others, we ask participants to pair with a colleague in small discussion groups. What does not work is ask them to “find a partner and meet with them before next week.” 

Put everyone into groups explicitly. Make it clear shuffle around can happen, but make sure groups are composed 2-3 people each. Ask them to schedule a regular/weekly 30m block for their partner. Some weeks, the time will go unused. However, it is better to have a weekly small group time slot than to have learning conversations *not* occur because of scheduling complexities.

### Planning Ahead: Prompting Learning

Assuming a weekly cadence for learning meetings, contact the learning cohort 1-2 days after the full-group facilitation. The note could highlight news that is related to the learner’s work, an inspirational note, or a quick message to ensure they remember to engage with the course material.  Also remind learners they can contact you with questions about the work.

### Planning the Lesson: The Lesson Prompt
Every lesson in the State Officer, M.D. course has a learning prompt. 
An example is included in the image below, or one can be found at the end of [any given lesson]({{ “/rubric/oo-high-2/” | prepend: site.baseurl }}). If you are facilitating any kind of group learning experience, we consider this kind of “play-by-play” or “minute-by-minute” plan to be *essential*. 
There are too many reasons for having a lesson plan; if nothing else, it is something to abandon when the group goes in a more interesting direction. However, an excellent lesson plan is about orchestrating a *learning experience in community with others*. When you develop a high quality plan, and execute it, you then have a framework against which you can concretely evaluate how the facilitated learning conversation went.

The prompt at the end of the [second high-priority rubric dimension of outcomes and orientation]({{ “/rubric/oo-high-2/” | prepend: site.baseurl }}) (pictured here) is an example. It suggests that participants will do some “writing to think” as part of the facilitation, taking one minute to write down 1) a single word and 2) a single sentence. ({% include link id =”wttla” text=”Writing to think” %} is a widely used learning strategy in K-12 and higher education.) This quiet time focuses them on what they want to say, forces them to be concise, and lets them share out the essence of their reflections with the group in a quick way, eliminating the possibility of long monologues on the part of participants. In under 15 minutes, every participant has a chance to contribute to the dialogue twice, *and* everyone is given time to reflect on what they and others have said as part of the facilitation. 

This kind of coordinated, participatory learning and dialogue does not happen accidentally. As a facilitator, becoming familiar with *group instructional training techniques* or *group work activities* will give you a rich toolbox for icebreakers and lightweight learning activities around which you can structure full-group learning activities. 

This lesson plan/agenda is the most important part of the facilitation. Expect to spend 1-2 hours planning it. The State Officer course has lesson plans sketched out for you, potentially reducing your preparation time greatly. If you improve a course facilitation plan, make sure to contribute them back to the site via pull request.

### Facilitation in Practice

For the first few sessions as a facilitator, you’ll be the learner. Be sure to learn the group member’s names and a little bit about their motivations, and background in the introductory session. Aspire to see the learners as whole people that you’ll learn more about as the sessions continue. Your own learning goal is to move your view of yourself past the role of leader, expert, or consultant and into the space of a colleague.
It helps to start sessions with a centering exercise to help yourself and the group move into this mindset. Leave at least 5 minutes at the start of the group discussion for learners to do a short exercise or meditation together, like sharing a fun event from their week or doing some focused breathing.

#### Running “The Show”

If the learners have engaged in their “homework,” if you have a good lesson plan for the full-group facilitation, and if the group knows that you are going to be engaging them in rich, reflective activities, there is a good chance that “running the show” is the easiest part of the process. 
Ideally, you have established some overall group norms at the beginning of the facilitation process. If not, you might want to gently guide the group into these practices over time.
1. **Step up, step back.** Make sure that everyone has space to contribute. Much of this work is about the State Officers transforming themselves in community with each other. Keep that distinction at the front of your mind at all times. If someone is contributing a lot, perhaps encourage them to pause for a moment, and see what their colleagues think. Likewise, make sure that *you* are not contributing too much. Your role is to facilitate, and occasionally chime in as an SME. You can tell them things, but you cannot *learn them* things. 
2. **Leave space for answers.** If you float a question&mdash;or, if one of the participants raises a question&mdash;create space for it. “What does everyone else think?” Then **count to 20** in your head. Generally, facilitators are willing to wait 2-3 seconds before jumping in. Practice waiting for the group. People need time to think, formulate thoughts, and work up the courage to speak. For you, the facilitator, that means explicitly conditioning yourself *not to say anything*. If you ask a question, be quiet for at least 8-10 seconds. If no one responds, ask if the question was clear, or if anyone has any thoughts. Then give them another 8-10 count. 
3. **Question the cohort.** Step back to encourage discussion and let learners lead the conversation. Prompt with questions when they help to jog the conversation in an open-ended direction, like explaining how a process fits into a framework or making a prediction about an outcome. Build opportunities for the cohort to tie back to personal experiences that can provide metaphors or even directly applicable examples. For help with questions that prompt learning, consult the resources below:

    * [Asking Questions to Improve Learning](https://ctl.wustl.edu/resources/asking-questions-to-improve-learning/)

### Feedback 

#### Throughout the course

You’ll get informal feedback from the cohort from the discussions, but feel free to prompt them for more if it seems useful. The Mural feedback form at the end of every lesson provides formal feedback. Remind the participants to fill out the form for each lesson at the end of each discussion session. You can check the results in Mural: Mural form for feedback after each lesson

#### Group reflection 

At the end of the course, it’s useful to review all the Mural form submissions and pick out any themes or standouts to discuss in a group reflection session. In the initial SOMD cohort, we created presentations with this feedback and discussed suggestions for course improvement with the group. We provided a few improvement suggestions based on the course feedback and wrote down any new suggestions that the group made. 

This is the agenda we used for the Course 1 group reflection session (This is what we did for Course 1 feedback/wrapup).

### Debrief

Do a debrief with your co-facilitator(s) after every session, especially while you are starting out as a facilitator. This provides you with a space to decompress, to reflect on whether you achieved your goals for the session, and what you intend to keep, change, add, or throw away from your practices for the next session. This regular retrospective practice allows you to discuss and incorporate feedback and to keep your values front-and-center throughout your practices and the facilitation process.
