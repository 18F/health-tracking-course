Let's take a minute to pause before we move on to the next few lessons in this course. Let's set the scene. Let's celebrate where we are now and take a look at where we're going.

Up to this point, the lessons may be seemed totally relevant to your daily work. You've probably seen roadmaps and thought about metrics and project management before. The material thus far has hopefully given you a new view on these familar aspects and markers you often encounter in your state's projects.

The next few lessons, however, may contain concepts that are newer to you. Centering the users, empathy, examining vendor contract language, and thinking about how a software development team tests the product may seem like details you don't need to think too much about. But having a good understanding of how these aspets of the development process work will help you determine when and why the process isn't working &mdash; even if you don't directly do the things described.
