Let's take a minute to pause before we move on to the next few lessons in this course. 

Up to this point, the lessons in courses one and two may be seemed mostly relevant to your daily work. You've probably seen roadmaps and thought about metrics and project management before. The material has hopefully given you a new view on these familar aspects and markers you often encounter in your state's projects.

The next few lessons, however, may contain concepts that are newer to you. Some may seem like details you don't need to think too much about. But having a good understanding of these aspects of the development process will help you determine when and why the process isn't working. You may not directly work on the things described in the next lessons, but knowing that they are markers of a healthy project will help you hone your view.

## Artifacts of the job (20m, solo)

The final three lessons of course two concern vendor contracts, user testing, and software testing. These are things that states may not offer up and asking about them may not be a part of your regular work process. Take a minute to write out what you wish you knew about one of your state's projects that you can't necessarily tell from the materials they give you. Maybe you want to know that their next release will work as described or that they'll be able to launch without a major failure. Think about some common artifacts you get from your state about their products &mdash; maybe they give you roadmaps, for example. then take a minute to write out things you wish you got from them -- maybe you wish you knew more about their relationship with their vendor, so you wish you had more time to help them navigate the selection and contracting process. Try to think about this independently of any time constraints you have on your work now. Write these examples down and bring them to the group meeting to discuss.
