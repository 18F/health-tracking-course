The course *State Officer, M.D.* is intended to help you, a State Officer, think critically about software and information technology projects. More specifically, it is intended to help you *question the health* of those projects.

Why would you want to know the "health" of a long-running, multi-million dollar software project? Nevermind... now that we ask the question, we realize that it is either 1) redundant or 2) outrageous. **Of course we want to know the health of long-running, multi-million dollar software projects!** The questions then become (more appropriately):

1. What questions, asked of whom, will help me make an accurate assessment of project health?, and  
2. What do I need to know to know if the answers to those questions are accurate and honest, or if I should call *bullshit*?

**To be clear**, we're using *bullshit* as a shorthand for a process of critical listening, insightful questioning, and collaborative process with all stakeholders involved that lead to successful product delivery and systems that are designed for, and usable by, the people we serve. But the spirit is there: a knowledgeable, questioning State Officer is always asking "is this going well, and if not, what can I do to help?"


The course [syllabus]({{ '/syllabus/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) has more to say about the course, and we recommend you give it a read while listening to some funky tunes that you enjoy. (Never read things while listening to *unfunky* tunes you *don't enjoy*.) You can also read it without the tunes, but we think the content goes better with a bit of the 70's and a solid horn section.
