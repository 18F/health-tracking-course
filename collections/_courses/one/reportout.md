# {{ page.title }}

The first course touches on the highest priority dimension of each indicator in the [health tracking rubric](/rubric/).

The content of this first course was guided by four broad, guiding questions:

1. **Assessing Health**. Is my state is on track for success?
2. **Questioning and Listening**. Is a state or vendor bullshitting me?
3. **Process and Action**. What steps can I take to improve project outcomes?
4. **Self and Community**. Am I confident in my work?

This last module is a chance to reflect and report out. **Reflection is a critical part of the learning process**.

## Things I Learned (30m, solo)

Take a free page in your notebook where you've been keeping track of your lesson notes for this course.

Take a half hour and go back through your notebook from this course sequence. As you do, make a list of things you learned or reflected on what helped you question and to listen to states and vendors. What things did we read, view, and discuss that helped you advance your ability to ask (and assess) whether you are being bullshitted? Make a note for each of the 4 lessons.

What was most surprising? What did you find most valuable? What practices or next steps do you hope to take as a state officer based on the material you've learned and discussed as a group?


## Discuss and Report Out (1h, in group)

To celebrate the completion of the first course, find time together to report out.

With your learning cohort, come back together to discuss your lessons learned and what you wrote down. You can do this in small groups.

As you're having this conversation, attempt to distill some of your learning down. If you could only share one thing with your colleagues from this course?

After you have captured these lessons learned, go back through the list. To each "lesson learned," attach an action. That is, what behavior, process, question, or next step can you take in your practice as a state officer that puts that lesson learned into practice?

When you're done, you'll have "lessons learned" and actionable "next steps" you can take. You'll have notes that you can use in a short document (or slide deck) that is able to be shared with a broader audience, like your fellow state officers.

## Congratulations! (?m, team)

Take time to celebrate your lessons learned and the actionable next steps. You've covered a top priority row from every Primary Indicator in the Health Rubric! 

Sharing lessons learned at a team huddle is an opportunity for your colleagues to lift you up for having undertaken this learning and a chance for you to share out how you hope to advance and grow as a state officer. 

Congratulations. You've completed course one. :tada: Look forward to course two, where you'll complete all the top priority rows of the Rubric.
