## Why become a state officer, M.D.?

You may not realize it, but our doctors don’t like it when we only come to them when we’re sick. If they had their way, most doctors would love to see us 1) more often, 2) for less time, and 3) help us make sure we take better care of ourselves so that 4) we wouldn’t get sick in the first place! As an SO, which kind of doctor would you rather be? We suspect you’d prefer more checkups, for less time, and avoid the need for major heart surgery when an improved diet and a short walk every day would do the same job!

This course is intended to help you apply your existing expertise as a State Officer in new ways. It will help you think about how to apply your expertise on a continuous basis instead of annually or bi-annually. This will help more projects succeed, and yield better and more robust services for the people that we serve.

## How will this course help you succeed?

There are three ways this course will help you improve your practices as an SO.

**Confidence in community**. The SOs are a team. As you engage in this learning, the most important thing you can leave with is the knowledge that you are not alone. You have a community of people to ask questions of and ask for advice as you learn new ways of thinking and new practices. 
 
**Strategy**. The “Doctor SO” needs to be thinking long term. We’ll lay a foundation for strategic approaches to managing the “long term care” of CMS projects going on in your state. These practices will give you a shared foundation with your fellow SOs and, over time, with your states and vendors, so that the entire community can move to a place of sustained health and well-being.
 
**Tactics**. Long-term health often involves dealing with troublesome patients in the short term. Through case studies and role-plays, we’ll explore challenges you’re likely to encounter, and provide some concrete approaches to shaping behavior for the better.


## Goals

Our goals are the "big picture." They are framed as questions that you should be asking yourself now and years from now as you engage in the work of improving how we serve the public.

1. **Assessing health**. Is my state is on track for success?
2. **Questioning and listening**. Is a state or vendor bullshitting me?
3. **Process and action**. What steps can I take to improve project outcomes?
4. **Self and community**. Am I confident in my work?

The word "bullshit" has a {% include link id="bullhistory" text="long, rich history" %}. It's root, *bull*, comes potentially from the Old French (*bole*) or Icelandic (*bull*), generally meaning to deceive or trick, or in the Icelandic, "nonsense." In 1600's English, it might mean "a ludicrous blunder involving a contradiction in terms," with evidence of its use in the English language going back to the 14th century. 

{% comment %}
It is the long and rich history of the word "bullshit" that inspires us to use it in the course goals. The purpose of this course is to learn strategies and tactics that will help you:

1. begin to identify bullshit in the contracting and project delivery process,
2. shift practices in the short (tactical) and long (strategic) term to help reduce the occurrence of bullshit, and ultimately
3. develop a process where all parties are confident in their work and agree it is not necessary to bullshit one another.

## Learning objectives

Learning objectives are the specific, measurable things we will learn through this course. The outcomes are explicitly structured around the [MES Health Rubric]({{ "/rubric/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}). 

Engaging with this course should increase your confidence in the 4 primary indicators of the MES Health Rubric:

### Outcomes-orientation

1. Describe short-term project value proposition and long-term alignment.
2. Appraise process and progress to appropriate baselines and metrics.
3. Assess user involvement and impact on project timeline and deliverables.
4. Relate individual and departmental priorities to projects' roadmap and value proposition.

### State capacity

1. Describe state's technical staffing and strategy (apart from vendor's strategy).
2.  Assess project staffing and needs.
3.  Grade the "bullshit score" of language regarding a project.
4.  Judge relationships within and between teams. 

### Procurement flexibility

1. Compare state's estimates of progress to personal assessments and expectations.
2. Rate contractual commitments to ongoing quality of process and product.
3. Summarize state's control of data and access to it.
4. Observe level of state commitment to outcomes and success.
5. Review state's understanding of vendor budget and project spending.

### Iterative development

1. Judge in-progress work (e.g. software demonstrations) over time, distinguishing progress from "canned" or otherwise "bullshit" demos.
2.  Review involvement of users as an ongoing aspect of development process.
3.  Critique security and migration processes.
4.  Rate ease of product deployment into production.
5.  Assess quality of software testing.
6.  Appraise system health and quality of health assessment tooling.
7.  Discuss project openness and the state decision making process regarding software openness.
