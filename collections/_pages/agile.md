# Agile Software Practices

It is possible that you have "agile fatigue," where you're tired of hearing about "agile software development." This would be legit&mdash;lots of people *talk* about it, but sometimes, they talk more than they *practice* it.

However, you can actually have "agile fatigue" at the **exact same time** as you're actually uncertain as to exactly what agile software development *really is*. 

We have two resources for you. Nothing we do can help you with agile fatigue, but we can *definitely* help you with understanding what agile is.

The video embedded below, {% include link id="foundationsagile" text="Foundations of Agile" %}, is based directly on the {% include link id="agileprinciples" %} guide. You could watch the video (for context), and later come back and read the guide. Or, perhaps you prefer reading to viewing, and you'd rather just read the guide. 

These resources care both intended for people who are new to agile.

## Foundations of Agile

The video below features Alan Atlas and Alan Brouilette of 18F, presenting on the basics of Agile software development. This session was hosted by 18F and DigitalGov University.

## Agile Principles and 18F Practices

If you prefer reading, you can hit {% include link id="agileprinciples" %}, a guide developed by 18F staff. The presentation by Alan and Alan draws directly from this guide, so don't be surprised if they seem like the same content. 

### Giving Back

If, as you read this guide, you found things that you think could be improved, expanded upon, or better explained, we'd love to hear from you. You can {% include link text="visit the agile guide source repository" id="apghrepo" %}, click on "Issues," and submit your thoughts. If you do that, the 18F team will hear what you have to say! And, in doing this, you'll be participating in a free and open source project by and for the US Government and, therefore, the people of the United States. That's kinda cool!
