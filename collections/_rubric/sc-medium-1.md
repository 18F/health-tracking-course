title: All The Managements
dimension: sc2.1
overview: |
   A successful software project will have many people involved, and those people will generally play different roles. In this lesson, we explore the kinds of management we might see in a long-running software project, and how people in those roles can contribute (or take away from) the success of a project.
---

Software projects are complex, creative projects that involve the orchestration of complex systems of hardware and software. The objective of this module is to lay foundations regarding the kinds of skills and capacities states should have for managing these projects. This will help you, as an SO, better support and evaluate the projects you are responsible for.

## Reflection: Products vs. Projects (15m, pair)

**Timer**: {%- include countdowntimer minutes=15 -%}

Before you dive into the learning material for this module, grab a friend. Your challenge is to think about all of the work that goes into managing large, long-lived products/projects. 

After checking in and saying hello, start a shared document (if you have access to something like Google Docs that allows for collaborative editing) and start making notes about all of the things you believe are involved in managing a large (software) project. If you don't have shared editing tools, one of you can take responsibility for taking notes, and sharing them after the conversation. And remember: even if you feel you don't have expertise in managing *software* projects, they are (at the end of the day) just *projects*. So do your best to generate a rich list of the management tasks that are likely involved in running such projects.

If finding time to work with a colleague is difficult, take 15 minutes to do this on your own. Or do it on your own, and then compare notes with a colleague when you're done. The goal is to do some pre-thinking before we dive into the learning, so that you're primed and ready for learning about **product** ownership/management and **project** management. 

## Program Management

### Watch: Product Ownership (45m, solo) 

In the previous activity, we blended *project* and *product* together. Now, it's time to start pulling those apart.

Let's start with *product ownership*, or *product management*. The first video we'll watch, {% include link id="wdpmd" attr="attribution duration" %}, is short, and provides a high-level overview of a product manager's role.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUOC-Y0f5ZQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The second video is a bit more in depth... it is, essentially, a *story*. In this video, {% include link id="kniberg" attr="attribution duration" %}, we are walked through the life of a well run, agile product being developed by a vendor (and delivered to a state). 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/502ILHjX9EE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As you watch these two videos, take notes. In particular, think about what kinds of activities a product manager at a vendor might be engaging in, and how you, as a state officer, could gain insight into the work they are doing. What kinds of questions might you be asking your state? If you can talk to the product manager at the vendor as part of your oversight, what kinds of questions would you want to ask to assess overall health? If you can't or are not talking to a PM at the vendor delivering solutions to the state... *should you be?* 

### Reflect: Program Management (15m, solo)

**Timer**: {% include countdowntimer minutes=15 %}

Before going on, pause. *Breathe*. 

At this point, get out your notebook. You've just been introduced to a bunch of ideas about *program ownership* or *program management*. 

Now, think about a project you've worked with---it could be your current project, or it could be one in the past.

* Was program management evident?
* Who was responsible for program management?
* How effective would you say they were in that role?
* What do you think was done well with regards to program management?
* What do you think could have been improved with regards to program management?

These are the kinds of questions you also want to keep in mind when thinking about applying the tracker to the health of projects taking place in your state.

## Project Management

### Read: Project Management (10m, solo)

The Project Management Institute is a source for learning and training around the practice of project management. Therefore, it seems like a good place to start if we're going to ask the question *what is project management?* The article ({% include link id="wipm" %}) is short.

### Watch: Unpacking the Jargon (15m, solo)

As a short list of terms, the PMI article leaves things to be desired. Mike Clayton goes a bit deeper, unpacking 12 terms that you'll hear thrown around (in conversation, in reports) regarding project management. This video ({% include link id="ttpmjtpmu" %}) is basically 12 one-minute videos back-to-back.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F25BGXAlaG0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To assess project health, you'll need to be able to keep up with the jargon. Frankly, *jargon is a great way to bullshit someone*. If I want you to 1) think I know what I'm talking about, but 2) confuse you along the way, I'm going to use jargon and words that I think you don't know well. If a product manager or project manager wants to mislead you regarding the health of a project, or otherwise mislead you as to how things are going, they're going to hide behind the words of their trade, and try and hide the realities of a project's health in the details.

### Watch: A Day In The Life of a Project Manager (12m, solo)

PMI tells us what a project manager does (in short), and Mike Clayton gives us some details about the terminology that you'll hear with regards to project mangagement, but... what is a day-in-the-life of a project manager like? 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nECjeK-mAMg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We chose Kristyn's video because it is relevant in multiple ways. Recorded at the end of June in 2020, this video speaks to what project management is like (for one woman) while working from home during a pandemic. This is not an attempt to capture the depth and breadth of life during a pandemic, but it gives us some insight into the reality of what is now going on across the nation as vendors and states adjust to new ways of working.

(Of course, you've done the same, so perhaps this is redundant. Even if we think the Covid-19 angle doesn't speak to us, it's still the story of one person working in this role, and the kinds of work they do.)

## Roleplay: Play the Part (45m, group)

To close out this lesson, come together with your learning cohort. 

1. **Checkin**. {% include countdowntimer minutes=10 %} How is everyone? Take a moment to go around the group, and offer up something that brought you joy this past week. Start with birthdays in December, and work backwards throguh the year.
2. **Prep**. {% include countdowntimer minutes=3 %} Now, count off, so that half of the group is an "Green" group and half the group is "Purple." The green group should put themselves in the place of their state's project, and imagine themselves as a program manager for that project. The purple group should take this time and imagine they are prepping for a conversation with the program manager to work on assessing project health. Take three minutes to prep for the roleplay.
3. **Breakout I**. {% include countdowntimer minutes=5 %} Break into pairs. The purple group should be playing the role of a state officer talking to the project's program manager, working to understand the health of the project. The green group should be playing the role of a program manager working on their state's software.
4. **Debrief I**. {% include countdowntimer minutes=15 %} After 5 minutes, come back to your large group. As a group, discuss the roleplays. 
   * For the purple group: What questions were particularly useful? What words/behaviors did you note from the program managers that were encouraging or inspired confidence? 
   * For the green group: How did getting into the program manager's head shape your thinking about the role of the SO? What mindset did you bring to the conversation? Was it collaborative? Evasive? Why?
5. **Repeat**. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4, but switching roles.
6. **Wrap**. {% include countdowntimer minutes=5 %} Take a moment, before leaving, to share what your favorite moments were from the learning activity. Go around the group, and offer one kudo to your roleplay partner---something they did that you thought was particularly wonderful, fun, or insightful.

<p>
    Roleplays are fun.
</p>

<p>
   They are also a powerful simulation tool. When you roleplay the vendor-side, you're stepping out of your normal headspace and attempting to imagine the system that you are part of from another perspective. In terms of evaluation, this is a critical skill.
</p>

<p>
   When you are roleplaying the State Officer engaging with the vendor, you're developing and practicing questioning skills that are fundamental to your work. But, you're practicing them in a safe environment where, if you make mistakes, you get to step back with colleagues and discuss what might have been a better approach.
</p>

<p>
   The point being: regardless of which role you are in, you're developing a powerful set of skills and habits of mind that are intended to improve your ability to imagine and detect bullshit (Learning Goal #2) as well as improve your confidence in digging into the work of your states and their vendors (Learning Goal #4). And at the risk of being redundant, let's be honest... <em>roleplays are fun</em>. <pre>:)</pre>

## Reflection (15-30m, small group)

*After the full group activity, meet with your partner or small group to do the following activity.*

CMS oversees large, complex projects that involve many people, lots of dollars, over a long period of time. The program and project managers on those projects are critical stakeholders in the process; they have leadership roles in the design and delivery of the software, and they are not without hopes, biases, and faults. As a SO, it is up to you to understand not only the projects they are overseeing, but these people and the roles they inhabit, so that you can better work with them and understand the progress being made on delivering excellent tools to the people.

Take some time to reflect on the roleplay, and the thoughts it inspired regarding your work with your state. 

* What questions might you begin asking going forward? 
* What processes do you think you might want change? 
* What processes are working well? 
* Are there more things you feel you need to learn to tackle this space better? 

Those questions are offered as starting points only. You are welcome to take your reflection in whatever direction is best for you.
